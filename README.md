# Cloud Boots!

Adds Cloud Boots to the Game!

* Cloud Boots give you the ability to walk in the air on a trail of clouds. Extremely useful for building large structures later on in your world. To counteract and balance the Cloud Boots, a couple of downsides have been implemented:

* Cloud Boots make you walk much slower, the same speed as soul sand. This eliminates them as a method of transport, and still keeps true to the heart of infrastructure and rail networks in BTA. 

* The Boots provide little to no protection, only 10-20 points in fall. (It's up to the devs to balance out protection points, personally I don't mind any stance.)

* While floating you are extremely vulnerable to projectiles, one hit and your clouds will disperse. This, combined with the previous downside, discourages the use of cloud boots in combat. Skeletons can easily shoot you down, and the slightest touch can evaporate your clouds.

Credit to @thaboar for the cloud texture, 
the boot texture came from the Cloud Boots mod from Tiviacz1337 
(I just ripped it as a place holder, plan on making one myself later), 
and the boots model is just a diamond boot placeholder model.
